# Neural Style Transfer using TensorFlow

## Introduction

Welcome to my repository for neural style transfer using TensorFlow! This project demonstrates the application of neural style transfer techniques to create artistic images by combining the content of one image with the style of another.

## Description

This repository contains Python code for performing neural style transfer using a pre-trained model from TensorFlow Hub. The code takes a content image and a style image as inputs and generates a stylized image that combines the content of the content image with the style of the style image.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have TensorFlow, TensorFlow Hub, Matplotlib, NumPy, and OpenCV installed in your Python environment.
2. Replace the file paths for the content and style images with your own image files.
3. Run the code and observe the generated stylized image.

Feel free to experiment with different content and style images to explore the capabilities of neural style transfer further!

## How to Run

To run the code, execute the Python script `Neural_Style.ipynb` in your preferred Python environment.

## Output of the model

Following are the input sample images for creating a neural style transfer image, which combines features of both images:
